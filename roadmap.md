# Learning Roadmap

This roadmap outlines learning intentions, not commitments.
It exists to provide structure without pressure.

## Current Focus — Foundations & Observability

- Understanding ICMP behavior and connectivity signaling
- Distinguishing transient network noise from real failure
- Exploring basic logging and state tracking

## Next Exploration — Security Primitives (Future)

- Understanding TCP handshakes and service exposure
- Exploring basic port availability safely and ethically
- Learning how surface area is detected, not exploited

## Constraints & Principles

- Learning over production
- Simple experiments before abstraction
- Safety and ethics first
- Documentation required for each stage

This roadmap will change as understanding improves.
