# Network Automation Labs

> A progressive systems-literacy laboratory documenting hands-on learning in networking and security.

## Purpose

This repository exists to support my ongoing learning in networking, security fundamentals, and Python — not to present finished tools or production systems.

Each folder contains small, deliberately scoped experiments designed to help me understand how networked systems behave in practice: how signals are generated, how failures appear, and how theory translates (or breaks) in real environments.

The emphasis here is on **learning through observation**, not optimization or feature completeness.

## Learning Philosophy

- **Foundations first:** Simple experiments before abstraction or automation  
- **Failure as signal:** Breakdowns and edge cases are part of the lesson  
- **Growth over polish:** Understanding matters more than clean architecture  
- **Documentation matters:** Notes capture what I learned, not just what worked  

This repository is expected to evolve as my understanding deepens.

## Structure & Progression

The labs are organized to reflect a gradual learning path:

### Stage 00 — Foundations
Basic protocol and connectivity experiments.  
Focus: understanding ground-truth behavior before building tools.

### Stage 01 — Observability
Exploring how systems are monitored and how state is inferred.  
Focus: thresholds, logging, and distinguishing noise from failure.

### Stage 02 — Security Primitives
Early exploration of security-related behavior.  
Focus: protocol handshakes, surface exposure, and safe experimentation.

Each stage includes notes documenting observations, confusion, and corrections.

## What This Repository Is

- A learning laboratory  
- A record of technical growth over time  
- A place to practice thinking about systems carefully  

## What This Repository Is Not

- A production-ready toolset  
- A cybersecurity operations repository  
- A showcase of advanced engineering  
- A finished or static portfolio  

## Context

This work supports my broader interest in evaluating technical systems by building first-principles understanding. Learning how infrastructure behaves helps me reason more clearly about reliability, failure modes, and trust in higher-level systems.

## Status

Active learning in progress.  
Structure, content, and depth will change as understanding improves.
