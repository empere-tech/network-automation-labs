# Reflections

## Initial Orientation

This repository exists to help me understand networking and security concepts by touching the system directly, not by jumping straight to automation.

At this stage, I’m not trying to build useful tools. I’m trying to notice:
- what surprises me,
- what assumptions I had that turned out wrong,
- and where theory feels incomplete when applied.

I expect most early experiments to feel trivial or incomplete. That’s intentional.

Future entries will capture specific observations, confusions, and course corrections as they occur.
